    config ESP_WIFI_SSID
        string "WiFi SSID"
        default "myssid"
        help
            SSID (network name) for the example to connect to.

    config ESP_WIFI_PASSWORD
        string "WiFi Password"
        default "mypassword"
        help
            WiFi password (WPA or WPA2) for the example to use.

    config SHOULD_COLLECT_CSI
        bool "Should this ESP32 collect and print CSI data?"
        default "y"
        help
            Allowing only a single ESP32 to collect CSI will likely increase the sampling frequency of your experiments.

    config SEND_CSI_TO_SERIAL
        bool "Send CSI data to Serial"
        default "y"
        help
            Sending data through serial (to a computer) can take time and buffer space.
            If you are storing to an SD card, it may be useful to deselect this option.

    config SEND_CSI_TO_SD
        bool "Send CSI data to SD"
        default "y"
        help
            Sending data to an SD card can take time and buffer space.
            If your ESP32 does not have an SD card, there is no reason to keep this behaviour.
            If you do though, the program will be recognize this and not attempt writing to the SD card.
